# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds live streaming capabilities to the existing reels system, allowing users to broadcast live video content to their followers in real-time. Users will have the option to either upload pre-recorded videos (existing functionality) or start a live stream using LiveKit SDK. The system will automatically notify followers when a live stream begins and provide a seamless viewing experience.

2. WHEN a user clicks "Go Live" THEN the system SHALL prompt for stream title and description
3. WHEN a user confirms live stream creation THEN the system SHALL initialize LiveKit room and provide camera/microphone access
4. WHEN live stream starts THEN the system SHALL create a live reel entry in the database
5. IF camera or microphone access is denied THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message and prevent stream creation

### Requirement 2

### Requirement 3

### Requirement 4
