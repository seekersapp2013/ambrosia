# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the article viewing issue in the Ambrosia social media platform. Currently, users can create articles (both free and paid) successfully, but neither the author nor other users can properly view the created articles. The issue appears to be in the ArticleReader component where articles are not displaying their content correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has created an article, I want to be able to view my published article with all its content displayed correctly, so that I can verify my content was published successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an article THEN the article SHALL be stored with valid contentHtml in the database
2. WHEN a user navigates to view their created article THEN the ArticleReader component SHALL display the full article content
3. WHEN the ArticleReader loads an article THEN it SHALL properly render the contentHtml using dangerouslySetInnerHTML
4. IF an article has no contentHtml or invalid contentHtml THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with debugging information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user browsing the platform, I want to be able to view articles created by other users, so that I can read and engage with community content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on an article in the feed THEN they SHALL be navigated to the ArticleReader component
2. WHEN the ArticleReader loads THEN it SHALL fetch the article data using the correct article ID
3. WHEN article data is successfully fetched THEN the component SHALL display the title, subtitle, author info, and full content
4. IF the article is gated and the user doesn't have access THEN the system SHALL show the paywall interface
5. IF the article is free or the user has access THEN the system SHALL display the full article content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the system, I want clear error handling and logging for article viewing issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve content display problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article fails to load THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console
2. WHEN contentHtml is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display debugging information including article ID, content type, and content length
3. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages to the user
4. WHEN articles are created THEN the system SHALL validate that contentHtml is properly formatted and stored

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user creating content, I want my article content to be properly formatted and stored, so that it displays correctly when viewed by myself and others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an article THEN the contentHtml SHALL be properly formatted with paragraph tags
2. WHEN plain text content is converted to HTML THEN line breaks SHALL be preserved as <br> tags within paragraphs
3. WHEN the article is saved THEN the contentHtml field SHALL contain valid HTML markup
4. WHEN the article creation is successful THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the stream and see their article in the feed
