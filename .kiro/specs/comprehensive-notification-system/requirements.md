# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the development of a comprehensive notification system that captures all user interactions on the platform and delivers notifications through multiple channels. The system will be extensible to support new notification types and delivery channels as the platform grows. Users will have granular control over their notification preferences through a dedicated settings interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications for all relevant interactions on the platform, so that I stay informed about engagement with my content and activities from users I follow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user gains a new follower THEN the system SHALL create a notification for the followed user
2. WHEN a user's follower posts new content THEN the system SHALL create a notification for all followers
3. WHEN a user receives claps on their content THEN the system SHALL create a notification for the content author
4. WHEN a user receives likes on their content THEN the system SHALL create a notification for the content author
5. WHEN a user receives comments on their content THEN the system SHALL create a notification for the content author
6. WHEN a user's content receives a payment THEN the system SHALL create a notification for the content author
7. WHEN a user receives a reply to their comment THEN the system SHALL create a notification for the original commenter
8. WHEN a user is mentioned in content or comments THEN the system SHALL create a notification for the mentioned user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the notification system to support multiple delivery channels, so that users can receive notifications through their preferred communication methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is created THEN the system SHALL support delivery through email channel
2. WHEN a notification is created THEN the system SHALL be extensible to support WhatsApp delivery
3. WHEN a notification is created THEN the system SHALL be extensible to support SMS delivery
4. WHEN a notification is created THEN the system SHALL be extensible to support push notifications
5. WHEN a notification is created THEN the system SHALL be extensible to support in-app notifications
6. WHEN adding a new delivery channel THEN the system SHALL require minimal code changes to existing notification logic
7. WHEN a delivery channel fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and attempt alternative channels if configured

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control which notifications I receive and through which channels, so that I can customize my notification experience to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing notification settings THEN the system SHALL display all available notification types
2. WHEN accessing notification settings THEN the system SHALL display all available delivery channels for each notification type
3. WHEN a user toggles a notification type THEN the system SHALL save the preference and apply it to future notifications
4. WHEN a user selects delivery channels THEN the system SHALL only send notifications through the selected channels
5. WHEN a user disables all channels for a notification type THEN the system SHALL not create notifications of that type for the user
6. WHEN notification preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately to new notifications
7. WHEN a user has no preferences set THEN the system SHALL use sensible default settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the notification system to be easily extensible, so that I can add new notification types for future features without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new notification type THEN the system SHALL require only defining the notification schema and trigger logic
2. WHEN adding a new notification type THEN the system SHALL automatically integrate with existing delivery channels
3. WHEN adding a new notification type THEN the system SHALL automatically appear in user notification settings
4. WHEN adding a new delivery channel THEN the system SHALL work with all existing notification types
5. WHEN adding a new delivery channel THEN the system SHALL automatically appear in user notification settings
6. WHEN the system processes notifications THEN it SHALL use a plugin-based architecture for delivery channels
7. WHEN the system creates notifications THEN it SHALL use a standardized notification format across all types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a history of all my notifications in the app, so that I can review past interactions and manage my notification status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the notifications screen THEN the system SHALL display all notifications in chronological order
2. WHEN viewing notifications THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate read vs unread status
3. WHEN clicking on a notification THEN the system SHALL mark it as read and navigate to relevant content if applicable
4. WHEN viewing notifications THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options (all, unread, by type)
5. WHEN viewing notifications THEN the system SHALL show the delivery channel used for each notification
6. WHEN viewing notifications THEN the system SHALL provide bulk actions (mark all as read, delete old notifications)
7. WHEN notifications are older than 30 days THEN the system SHALL automatically archive them but keep them accessible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want notification batching and intelligent timing, so that I'm not overwhelmed by too many notifications at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple notifications of the same type occur within 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL batch them into a single notification
2. WHEN a user is actively using the app THEN the system SHALL delay email notifications for 10 minutes
3. WHEN a user has "Do Not Disturb" hours set THEN the system SHALL queue notifications and send them after the quiet period
4. WHEN batching notifications THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all included interactions
5. WHEN a user receives high-priority notifications THEN the system SHALL send them immediately regardless of batching rules
6. WHEN notification frequency exceeds 10 per hour THEN the system SHALL automatically enable batching mode
7. WHEN a user hasn't been active for 24 hours THEN the system SHALL send a digest of all pending notifications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive analytics on notification delivery and engagement, so that I can optimize the notification system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL track delivery success rates by channel
2. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL track user engagement rates (open, click, dismiss)
3. WHEN notifications fail to deliver THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and retry logic
4. WHEN users interact with notifications THEN the system SHALL track which types drive the most engagement
5. WHEN analyzing notification data THEN the system SHALL provide insights on optimal sending times
6. WHEN notification preferences are changed THEN the system SHALL track preference patterns across users
7. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL maintain notification delivery performance metrics
